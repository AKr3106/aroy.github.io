Shri Arijit Dey, Head Teacher<br>

On 15th August 1947, India gained independence, but it was also divided. East Pakistan was formed, leading to the migration of millions of people from East Bengal to West Bengal. These displaced individuals faced uncertainty and lacked basic necessities such as shelter and food. However, they held onto their hope and determination as they entered an unknown land, fighting for their lives. Kalyannagar Colony symbolizes the resilience of these determined individuals.

Devendranath Ghosh, a brilliant student who secured the first position in Calcutta University's matriculation examination in 1926, was a high-ranking government servant in 1947. He stood alongside the migrants, having close connections with various government departments due to his employment. Devendranath and his classmate Gnandaranjan Bagchi selected a place outside Calcutta for resettlement and named it 'Kalyanagar' in January 1949. Gradually, the population of Kalyannagar Colony began to increase.
<br>
Devendranath Ghosh went beyond establishing a colony and also set up a school to shape the future generation into responsible citizens. In December 1950, an 'Education Committee' was formed with prominent locals. This committee agreed to establish a school from the following year. At Devendranath's suggestion, the proposed school was named "Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth." A location was designated for Vidyapeeth, which initially consisted of a mud-walled house in a forested area. The site was cleared, and additional houses were built. The large compound housed spacious homes on the south and east sides, with tiled rice paddies and bamboo fences. Classrooms were created within these fenced houses, sometimes transforming into a hall for various school events. The teachers' living quarters and office were located to the north.<br>

Despite the limited number of houses in Kalyannagar, the atmosphere was serene, resembling a monastic environment. A large mango tree stood in the central courtyard, where occasional classes were held during the summer. The chirping of birds and the sounds of children blended harmoniously, creating a pleasant natural ambiance.

Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth commenced on January 2, 1951, with **Kalipada Bagchi** as the headmaster, **Abhyacharan Acharya** as the clerk, two male students, and one female student. The first enrolled student was Gopal Chandra Chattopadhyay, who joined in class VIII. Gurupada Chakraborty and Geeta Chakraborty were the other two students. As more people from East Bengal settled in the surrounding area, such as Panshila, Shantinagar, Faridpur Colony, Madaripur Colony, and Rahara, the headmaster encouraged residents to send their children to the school. Initially, only a few students enrolled, but by April 1952, the number had grown to around 70.<br>

The early teachers at Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth were Kalipada Bagchi (headmaster), Mahendranath Bhowmik, Yogendramohan Saha, and Parimohan Chakraborty. In July 1952, Ananthakumar Roy joined as the headmaster, with Kalipada Bagchi becoming the assistant headmaster. Ananthkumar Roy was a renowned teacher from Santosh Janhvi High School in Tangail. Devendranath Ghosh had topped the matriculation examination after studying under him. Under Ananthkumar Roy's leadership, the school flourished, and more teachers such as Ajaykumar Ghosh, Sudhirkumar Adhikari, Vijaykumar Basu, Shailendramohan Sarkar, and Dhirendrakumar Acharya joined the staff. The students' education thrived under the personal guidance and dedication of these teachers, resulting in a continuous increase in student enrollment.

In 1953, Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth (Boys) was approved as a secondary school by the West Bengal Madhya Shiksha Parshad. In 1965, it was recognized as a Class XI Higher Secondary School, initially offering arts courses and later adding science courses. In 1977, the West Bengal Board of Higher Secondary Education approved it as a Class XII Higher Secondary School.<br>

Initially, a ***temporary committee*** managed the school, with Professor **Anil Chandra Baneerjee** from Calcutta University serving as the president and **Gnanadacharan Bagchi** as the editor. However, Devendranath Ghosh handled most of the responsibilities. From July 1952 to May 1965, Debendranath Ghosh served as the editor, playing a vital role in the Vidyapeeth's development. He tirelessly worked to secure government funding for various needs, starting with land and building the school. He invested his time, labor, and money into the school.

Over time, Vidyapeeth expanded in size and facilities. A new school building was constructed, equipped with all the amenities of a modern school. Computer education was introduced from class V, and office operations were modernized.<br>

We are proud to announce that the West Bengal State Board of Vocational Education and Training, under the Department of Technical Education and Training, Government of West Bengal, has approved our school to offer technical training. This program was implemented from the academic year 2011, allowing secondary graduates to enroll in the training.

To preserve the memory of late **Nakula Chandra Das, the founder of Vidyapeeth**, his sons Sreesanka Das and Srinanigopal Das generously donated funds for the procurement of necessary equipment and modernizing the chemistry, biology, and geography laboratories. This initiative has enabled the modernization of various facilities within our school. The computer house is air-conditioned. In *memory* of **Mr. Ahindrakumar Bandyopadhyay**, **a former teacher**, and *late Rabindranath Sinha, a former student, their wife Aparna Sinha donated Rs.5000 and Rs.2211, respectively, for the financial assistance of meritorious and needy students at Vidyapeeth. Since the academic year 2011-12, scholarships have been awarded to deserving students from this fund*. Additionally, the Center for *Cultural Research and Training (CCRT)* under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, has approved the formation of a Cultural Club at our Vidyapeeth.<br>

The examination results of Vidyapeeth students have been consistently impressive. Many students from lower middle-class and below poverty line families enroll in our school. In recent years, almost 100 percent of our students have passed the secondary examination with good marks. The higher secondary examination results have also been commendable. Numerous students have excelled in various fields of society after their education at Vidyapeeth, becoming doctors, engineers, qualified teachers, professors, high-ranking employees, athletes, singers, mayors, political leaders, philanthropists, and more. To conclude, I would like to share the words of one of the early teachers of this school, Dr. Ajay Kumar Ghosh, who later became a professor of medicine. He said, "Through happiness and sorrow, ups and downs, this school stands strong in its glory, holding great promise. With highly educated and qualified teachers, the dedicated efforts of Kalyannagar citizens, and the goodwill of local residents, this institution will continue to grow... I extend my best wishes."

Devendranath Ghosh (27.9.1910–4.6.1966) was the founder of Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth. He was a brilliant student himself. He was also an *electronics enthusiast and a children's writer*. The books written by him include *'Birer Dal,' 'Abhiyan,' 'Kanchenjunga Abhiyan' (Drama), 'A Kagani Chai' (Drama), 'Career for High School Boys,' 'Career for High School Girls,' and 'Small Industries.'* Devendranath Ghosh was a learned researcher, and his research paper titled *'Theory of Middle Class People'* was completed under the guidance of Bhavatosh Dutta. Unfortunately, due to his sudden death in a jeep accident in 1966, the paper could not be submitted. His book 'Birer Daal' for teenagers was published in 1349(Bengali calender).<br>

In 2010, the birth centenary of Devendranath Ghosh, the founder of Kalyannagar township and Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth, was celebrated. Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth organized a grand function to pay tribute to him on his birthday. The meeting was attended by his family members, former teachers, current students, teachers, and education workers. Later, the newly constructed south-east block of the school was named the 'Devendranath Ghosh Birth Centenary Building,' which now houses three classrooms, a language center, and geography and chemistry laboratories. His son, Srideepak Kumar Ghosh, inaugurated this building.

Devendranath Ghosh, born on 27th September 1910, spent his early years in Gaudangi village, Mymensingh. His father, Govindmohan Ghosh, was a surveyor, and the family was modest in size, with two brothers and three sisters. Devendranath excelled in his studies, passing his matriculation examination in 1926 from Mymensingh Janhvi High School. His academic journey continued with an intermediate degree from Presidency College, followed by a B.A., M.A. in Economics, and later an [M.Sc](http://m.sc/). in Astrology, all completed between 1926 and 1932. Devendranath was known for his brilliance, and he began writing essays for the Daily Statesman.
<br>
In the early 1950s, Devendranath became involved in government service and served as an intelligence officer in the Department of Industry. As the country achieved independence, he rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming the director of the Department of Industry in 1952. He worked closely with Bidhan Chandra Roy, the leader of Bengal during this time. Devendranath continued his career as the Additional Director of the Industries Department until his untimely demise on June 4, 1966.

However, it was his remarkable contributions outside the government office that left a lasting legacy. Devendranath was instrumental in establishing Kalyannagar, a planned suburb, which provided shelter to numerous families and changed the face of the region. He initiated the Kalyannagar Cooperative Society and played a pivotal role in shaping the area's development.
<br>
Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth, a school he founded in 1952, has been an enduring source of education and progress for the local community. Devendranath actively participated in the school's growth, even teaching English at times. The school continues to shine a light on knowledge and has positively impacted the lives of many families over the past 60 years.

Devendranath Ghosh was not only an educator but also a celebrated writer. His book 'Birer Daal' remains an essential part of the Best Juvenile Collection, although his true identity as its author is often overlooked. In addition to his writing, Devendranath was a researcher and kept a daily diary, revealing his innermost thoughts and struggles.
<br>
His contributions to the community, the establishment of Kalyannagar, and the enduring presence of Kalyannagar Vidyapeeth have solidified Devendranath Ghosh's place in history. His memory lives on, as he created an indelible mark in the hearts of the people he served and inspired.</b><br>
